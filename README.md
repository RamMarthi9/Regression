Q1. What is Regression? How is it used in data analysis?

    Regression is a statistical method used to model and analyze the relationship between a dependent variable (target) 
    and one or more independent variables (predictors). It is one of the most fundamental and widely applied techniques in data analysis and machine learning.

    The primary goal of regression is to predict outcomes or quantify the strength and nature of relationships between variables. 
    Regression allows us to make data-driven decisions by identifying patterns and trends in datasets.

    In summary, regression is a cornerstone of data analysis, enabling predictions and insights critical for informed decision-making. 
    By choosing the appropriate type of regression and ensuring assumptions are met, analysts can extract meaningful information from complex datasets.

Q2. Explain the equation of a simple linear regression model. What do the terms represent?
    The general form of the simple linear regression equation is: y = mx + c + e

    y is value to be predicted -- Dependent Variable/ Predictor Variable
    x is value which helps in predicting y -- Independent Variable
    m is change in y for one unit increase in x 
      -- slope or coefficient
      -- represents the strength and direction of the relationship between x and y
    c is value of y when x = 0 
      -- It represents the baseline value of the dependent variable when there is no influence from the independent variable.

Q3. What assumptions does Linear Regression make? Can you name at least four?
  1. Linearity
  2. No Multicollinearity
  3. Independence of errors
  4. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)
  5. Normality of Residuals

    1. Linearity
        Assumption: The relationship between the independent variables (𝑥) and the dependent variable (𝑦) is linear.

        Why it Matters: Linear regression can only accurately model linear relationships. If the relationship is nonlinear, predictions will be biased.

        How to Check: Plot the dependent variable against each independent variable to visualize linearity.
        Residual plots: Residuals should not show patterns when plotted against predictors.

    2. Independence of Errors
        Assumption: The residuals (errors) are independent of each other.

        Why it Matters: Correlated errors can lead to underestimation of standard errors, invalidating significance tests.

        How to Check: Use the Durbin-Watson test for autocorrelation (especially in time-series data).
        Ensure no logical dependency exists between observations (e.g., time-dependent patterns).

    3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)
   
        Assumption: The variance of residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variables.

        Why it Matters: Heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance) can make the model inefficient and bias the standard errors, leading to incorrect confidence intervals and p-values.
        How to Check: Plot residuals against predicted values; there should be no cone-shaped pattern. Perform statistical tests like Breusch-Pagan or White’s test.

    4. Normality of Residuals
        Assumption: The residuals (errors) follow a normal distribution.
        Why it Matters: This assumption is crucial for valid hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals.
        How to Check: Create a Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot) of residuals. Points should fall along the diagonal. Use the Shapiro-Wilk test or Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality.

    5. No Multicollinearity: Independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other.
    6. No Measurement Error: Independent variables are measured without error.

      Why These Assumptions Matter
      Violations of these assumptions can lead to:
        Biased or inefficient estimates.
        Invalid p-values and confidence intervals.
        Misleading interpretations of the model.
        If assumptions are violated, alternative methods (e.g., transformations, robust regression, or regularization techniques like Ridge/Lasso) may be required.

Q4. What is the difference between simple and multiple linear regression?
     
     1. Simple linear regression and multiple linear regression are both types of linear regression, but they differ in the number of independent variables used to predict the dependent variable.

     Here's a detailed comparison:
     Involves one independent variable (𝑥) to predict the dependent variable (𝑦).

     Multiple Linear Regression:
     Involves two or more independent variables (𝑥1,𝑥2,…,𝑥𝑛) to predict the dependent variable (𝑦).

    2. Complexity
    Simple Linear Regression:

    Easier to compute and interpret as it involves only one predictor.
    Visualized as a straight line in a 2D space (scatter plot).
    
    Multiple Linear Regression:

    More complex because it considers multiple predictors.
    Visualized as a hyperplane in an n-dimensional space (not easily visualizable for more than 3 predictors).

What is multicollinearity? How does it affect a linear regression model?

Multicollinearity refers to the situation where two or more independent variables in a multiple linear regression model are highly correlated with each other. This means that one independent variable can be predicted or explained by a combination of the other independent variables.

How it affects a linear regression model:

1. Unstable Coefficients: When multicollinearity is present, the regression coefficients (the values that multiply the independent variables) become highly sensitive to small changes in the data. This makes the model's coefficients unstable, meaning they might fluctuate significantly with small variations in the data.


2. Inflated Standard Errors: High correlation among the predictors increases the standard errors of the estimated coefficients. This leads to less reliable estimates and makes it harder to determine whether a predictor is significantly contributing to the model.


3. Difficulty in Interpretation: If two or more predictors are highly correlated, it becomes difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor on the dependent variable because their effects are intertwined.


4. Reduced Predictive Power: While the model might still fit the data well (low residuals), multicollinearity can reduce the model's ability to generalize to new data. This can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.



Common Symptoms of Multicollinearity:

High variance inflation factor (VIF) values for the independent variables.

A high correlation matrix showing values close to 1 or -1 between pairs of predictors.


Solutions to Multicollinearity:

Remove highly correlated predictors.

Combine predictors through techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Regularization techniques like Ridge or Lasso regression can help by adding a penalty to the model, thereby reducing the impact of multicollinearity.


What is the significance of the p-value in a regression model?

The p-value in a regression model is a statistical measure used to determine whether the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable is statistically significant. It helps assess the null hypothesis, which typically states that there is no effect or relationship between the variables.

Here's what the p-value signifies:

1. Null Hypothesis Testing: The p-value tests the null hypothesis (usually that the coefficient of a variable is zero, indicating no relationship). A low p-value suggests that the null hypothesis can be rejected, and the independent variable is likely to have a significant effect on the dependent variable.


2. Threshold for Significance: A common threshold for significance is 0.05:

If the p-value ≤ 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the variable has a significant effect on the outcome.

If the p-value > 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, implying that the variable may not have a significant effect on the outcome.



3. Interpretation: A smaller p-value (e.g., 0.01) indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, meaning the predictor is more likely to be a significant contributor. Conversely, a larger p-value (e.g., 0.10 or 0.20) suggests weaker evidence, and we might consider removing that predictor from the model.



Limitations:

P-value depends on sample size: In large datasets, even trivial effects can yield small p-values. Conversely, in small datasets, meaningful effects might not be statistically significant.

Doesn't measure strength of the effect: A low p-value tells you that an effect is statistically significant, but it doesn't tell you the size or practical importance of that effect.


In summary, the p-value in a regression model helps determine whether the relationship between a predictor and the outcome is statistically significant, guiding decisions about including variables in the model.

How do you handle categorical variables in linear regression?
Categorical variables cannot be directly used in linear regression because the model operates on numerical values. To handle categorical variables effectively, you need to convert them into a numerical format. Here are common techniques to achieve this:

1. Label Encoding

Assigns a unique integer to each category.

Example:

"Red" → 0, "Green" → 1, "Blue" → 2.


When to use:

For ordinal data (categories with an inherent order, e.g., "Low," "Medium," "High").


Limitation:

May introduce an unintended ordinal relationship for nominal data.




---

2. One-Hot Encoding

Creates binary (0 or 1) columns for each category.

Example for "Color" with categories ["Red," "Green," "Blue"]:

Red   Green   Blue
1     0       0
0     1       0
0     0       1

When to use:

For nominal data (categories without a meaningful order).


Limitation:

Increases the dimensionality if there are many unique categories.




---

3. Dummy Encoding

A variant of one-hot encoding that drops one column to avoid the dummy variable trap (perfect multicollinearity).

Example for "Color" with ["Red," "Green," "Blue"]:

Green   Blue
0       0   → Red
1       0   → Green
0       1   → Blue

Linear regression inherently handles this without explicitly dropping columns in many libraries.



---

4. Frequency or Count Encoding

Replace categories with their frequency or count in the dataset.

Example:

"Red" → 10 (occurs 10 times),
"Green" → 20,
"Blue" → 5.

When to use:

When the frequency of categories carries meaningful information.




---

5. Mean Encoding (Target Encoding)

Replace each category with the mean of the target variable for that category.

Example:

If the average sales for "Red," "Green," and "Blue" are 50, 60, and 70, respectively:

"Red" → 50, "Green" → 60, "Blue" → 70.


When to use:

When there’s a strong relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable.


Caution: Risk of overfitting; use with techniques like k-fold cross-validation.



---

6. Binary Encoding

Combines label encoding and one-hot encoding.

Converts categories into binary and then splits them into columns.

Example:

Category IDs: ["A" → 1, "B" → 2, "C" → 3].

Binary representation: [01, 10, 11].


When to use:

To reduce dimensionality compared to one-hot encoding.




---
