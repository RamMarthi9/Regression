Metric,Definition,Reason for Creation,What It Measures,Formula,Use Cases
MAE (Mean Absolute Error),Average of absolute differences between actual and predicted values.,"Created to provide a simple, interpretable measure of error magnitude.",Measures average magnitude of errors.,MAE = (1/n) * Σ |y_i - ŷ_i|,Use when interpretability and robustness to outliers are important.
MSE (Mean Squared Error),Average of squared differences between actual and predicted values.,"Emphasizes larger errors due to squaring, helping highlight significant deviations.",Measures average squared error magnitude.,MSE = (1/n) * Σ (y_i - ŷ_i)^2,Used for optimization and detecting significant errors.
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error),"Square root of MSE, providing error measure in original units of response variable.","Combines benefits of MSE with interpretability in original scale, avoiding squaring bias.",Measures root of average squared errors.,RMSE = sqrt((1/n) * Σ (y_i - ŷ_i)^2),Best for datasets where large errors need to be penalized.
RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error),Similar to RMSE but applies logarithm to predicted and actual values.,"Handles relative prediction errors better, focusing on proportional differences.",Measures proportional differences in errors.,RMSLE = sqrt((1/n) * Σ (log(1 + y_i) - log(1 + ŷ_i))^2),"Ideal for cases with exponential growth or varying scales, e.g., revenue predictions."
MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error),Mean of absolute percentage errors between actual and predicted values.,"Provides a scale-independent error measure, expressed as a percentage.",Measures relative error percentage.,MAPE = (1/n) * Σ |(y_i - ŷ_i)/y_i| * 100,Best for understanding forecast accuracy in business and financial applications.
R² (Coefficient of Determination),Proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model.,Indicates goodness of fit and overall model performance.,Measures explained variance.,"R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot), where SS_res = Σ (y_i - ŷ_i)^2",Used for assessing model performance in regression analysis.
Adjusted R²,Adjusted version of R² that accounts for model complexity.,Penalizes addition of irrelevant predictors to prevent overfitting.,Measures adjusted explained variance.,"Adjusted R² = 1 - ((1-R²)(n-1)/(n-p-1)), where p = number of predictors, n = sample size.",Useful for comparing models with different numbers of predictors.
Huber Loss,Combines MAE and MSE to handle both small and large errors robustly.,Mitigates sensitivity to outliers while maintaining performance on small errors.,Balances sensitivity to small and large errors.,"L = (1/2)(y_i - ŷ_i)^2 if |y_i - ŷ_i| ≤ δ, else δ|y_i - ŷ_i| - (1/2)δ^2",Common in robust regression and deep learning scenarios.
MSLE (Mean Squared Logarithmic Error),Mean of squared logarithmic differences between actual and predicted values.,"Highlights relative prediction performance, especially for skewed data.",Measures log-transformed squared errors.,MSLE = (1/n) * Σ (log(1 + y_i) - log(1 + ŷ_i))^2,"Best suited for growth prediction models (e.g., population, income)."
